                            What’s the most typically British thing about you? I put ketchup on everything and can’t start my day without a cup of tea. – or end it.
                            Your favorite word or phrase? “It’s not my cup of tea.” This expression is so British, and we use it to say something is not to one’s liking or preference.
                            What fashion trends are you seeing in your hometown? Unfortunately, I am not home very often; I am studying at UCL Bartlett while pursuing a modelling career. There, I have noticed a strong emphasis on functional and stylish fashion among architecture students. Both students and lecturers invest in durable, high-quality clothing, opting for popular outdoor brands like RAINS, renowned for their waterproof features. </p>
